## Introduction:

1.  The SUBJECT of study. In this project weÂ´ll study evolution of
    salaries in the USA through the last 40 years. In particular we'll
    be interested in analyzing and describing relationships between
    education and demographic variables and wages.

2.  MEASURING EFFECTS. How do these variables impact wages, how do
    the potential effects of these variables evolve through time? Are
    there significant differences based on such variables?

3.  DATA available. We'll use the data.set
    "wages-by-education-in-the-usa-1973-2022" from Kaggle. Using Data
    Wrangling and visualization, we will explore the data assess our
    first perceptions and define our working hypothesis.

4.  In order to understand the test our working hypothesis, we'll
    utilize least square estimates,linear regression techniques.

5.  Further to this, we'll implement a model which will take into
    account the accumulative effects of variables on outcomes,

6.  Finally we'll draw some conclusions, impact of the findings (effect
    of variables) on the subject of study (pay- outcome).




## Parts 1 and 2 - Subject of study and Measuring Effects.

Defining the focus of the study, as described in point 1 and 2 in the
introduction above:
We'll be interested in measuring effects of demographics (variables) on wages.

## Reviewing DATA

List of unique columns


```{r}
col_names_edu <- colnames(wages_edu)
col_names_edu
```


Viewing the first part of the data.frame:


```{r}
head(wages_edu)
```


Displaying the internal strcuture of the data set:


```{r}
str(wages_edu)
```


'data.frame': 50 obs. of 61 variables

We'd like to have a more manageable data frame. We want to transform it
to Tidy Data. Tidy format in which each row represents one observation
and columns represent (combinations of) the different variables
available for each of these observations. We could consolidate the
information reshaping the data: we could organize data in 5 columns, 4
selection variables, Education level (edu_level; edu_5), Race (race), 
Gender (gender), Time (year), and the result of the observation or fifth 
variable Wages (pay)(value USD per h).

We will iniciate the process of DATA WRANGLING, converting the data set
to tidy form. We can observe that data can be organized in 12 groups:
-All, All-Men, All-Women, All-Black,All-White,All-Hispanic; 
-Men-Black, Women-Black, Men-White, Women-White, Men-Hispanic, Women-Hispanic. 
All of these groups have 5 possible values for the education level.

We'll generate following these 12 groups as data.frames from
"wages_edu", all with a Tidy format:


-6B.1_wages_edu_all: year=all ; gen=all ; race=all ; level_edu=all
five ; pay=values

-6B.2_wages_edu_Men: year=all ; gen=Men ; race=all ; level_edu=all
five ; pay=values

-6B.3_wages_edu_Women: year=all ; gen=Women ; race=all ;
level_edu=all five ; pay=values

-6B.4_wages_edu_B: year=all ; gen=all ; race=Black ; level_edu=all
five ; pay=values

-6B.5_wages_edu_W: year=all ; gen=all ; race=White ; level_edu=all
five ; pay=values

-6B.6_wages_edu_H: year=all ; gen=all ; race=Hispanic ; level_edu=all
five ; pay=values

-6A.1_wages_edu_M_B: year=all ; gen=Men ; race=Black ; level_edu=all
five ; pay=values

-6A.2_wages_edu_M_W: year=all ; gen=Men ; race=White ; level_edu=all
five ; pay=values

-6A.3_wages_edu_M_H: year=all ; gen=Men ; race=Hispanic ;
level_edu=all five ; pay=values

-6A.4_wages_edu_W_B: year=all ; gen=Women ; race=Black ;
level_edu=all five ; pay=values

-6A.5_wages_edu_W_W: year=all ; gen=Women ; race=White ;
level_edu=all five ; pay=values

-6A.6_wages_edu_W_H: year=all ; gen=Women ; race=Hispanic ;
level_edu=all five ; pay=values



Let's prepare the first of these 12 data.frames, 6B.1:


6B.1_wages_edu_all: year=all ; gen=all ; race=all ; level_edu=all five; 
pay=values


```{r}
wages_edu_all <- wages_edu %>%      select(year,less_than_hs,high_school,some_college,bachelors_degree,advanced_degree)
head(wages_edu_all)
    
tidy_wages_edu_all <- gather(wages_edu_all, edu_level, pay, `less_than_hs`:`advanced_degree`)
head(tidy_wages_edu_all)
tidy_wages_edu_all <-tidy_wages_edu_all %>% mutate(gender="All", race="All") %>% mutate(edu_5=c(1:250))
```


We'll prepare these 12 data.frames from the main source, and work on
transforming them to tidy data. In the process, in order to improve and
complete tidiness of data, we'll focus on the edu_level variable. This has 
55 different values, while there are actually only 5 different levels of 
education being considered in the original data. The "edu_level" variable 
includes gender and race variables within in the original data frame structure. 
We'll reduce that complexity to 5 actual education level values (hereby 
referred as "a","b","c","d","e"),from the maximum education level 
(advanced degree), now level "a",to the minimum education level,"less than hs", 
hereby level "e".

Our new education level naming convention is then as following:

-"a" = "advanced_degree" 

-"b" = "bachelors_degree" 

-"c" = "some_college" 

-"d" = "high_school" 

-"e" = "less_than_hs"

Preparing the twelfth of the 12 data.frames, 6A.6:

```


Now we've made data tidy, and have created 12 data frames:
6A.1,6A.2,6A.3,6A.4,6A.5,6A.6; 6B.1,6B.2,6B.3,6B.4,6B.5,6B.6.

Let's combine them all together, so we can start data
exploration-analysis. We need to add rows. We'll use the bind_rows
function from tidyverse:


```{r}
    df6A <- bind_rows(list(df6A1,df6A2,df6A3,df6A4,df6A5,df6A6))
    df6B <- bind_rows(list(df6B1,df6B2,df6B3,df6B4,df6B5,df6B6))
    df12 <- bind_rows(list(df6A,df6B))
   
    #Let's display the internal strcuture of the new formed data frame:
    head(df12)
    str(df12)
```


Level of education is now contained in two variables, "edu_level" and
"edu_5". We'll create a data frame showing only one variable for
education level, selecting "edu_5", since edu_5 does not include other
additional (demographics) information:


```{r}
    df12_t <- df12 %>% select(year,gender,race,edu_5,pay)
    
    head(df12_t)
    str(df12_t)
```


We can compare "df12" and "df12_t", see how df12_t (Tidy) is the Tidiest
version:


```{r}
    unique_columns_count <-  df12 %>%
      summarise(n_year = n_distinct(year),
                n_edu_level = n_distinct(edu_level),
                n_gender = n_distinct(gender),
                n_race = n_distinct(race),
                n_edu_5=n_distinct(edu_5),
                n_pay = n_distinct(pay))
    print(unique_columns_count)
   
    unique_columns_count <-  df12_t %>%
      summarise(n_year = n_distinct(year),
                n_gender = n_distinct(gender),
                n_race = n_distinct(race),
                n_edu_5=n_distinct(edu_5),
                n_pay = n_distinct(pay))
    print(unique_columns_count)
```


Summary (df12_t -vs- df12): edu_level variable had 55 different values,
while there are actually only 5 different levels of education being
considered. "edu_level" included gender and race variables within. We
have now simplified these 55 values, to the 5 actual education level
values, without loosing the additional information contained in
"edu_level".

Data exploration: once we've got data re-organized (Tidy), let's start with
representing data through data visualization tools:

Starting with "generic data" (data including "All" races, "All" genders,
"All" races and genders) compare avg values versus segmented data (by
race, by gender). See how education level and year affect wages: We
can select a race and gender, see how the level of education plays a
role in the wages level (pay) through time:


```{r}
    df12_t %>%
      filter(race == "All",gender == "All") %>%
      ggplot(aes(year, pay, color = edu_5)) +
      geom_line()+
      xlab("YEAR") +
      ylab("WAGES [$/h]") +
      ggtitle("Wages by education level (edu_5)")
```


This plot provides already a visual overview of the evolution of wages, based 
on the 5 different education levels considered, through time. 
By education level, through time, we observe: 

-Level "a", advanced degree, has evolved from around 37 (dollars per hour) 
in 1973 to around 54 (dollars per hour) in 2022. 
Note we'll use the abbreviation 'dph' for 'dollars per hour' onwards. 
-Level "b", bachelor degree, has evolved from around 33dph in 1973 to around 
42dph in 2022. 
-Level "c", some college, advanced degree, has changed little, from around
24dph in 1973 to around 25$/h in 2022. 
-Level "d", high-school, has
stagnated around 22dph, from 1973 until 2022.Dropping 2 to 3dph through
the mid 90s, recovering in the mid 2000s,just to drop adn recover again
around 2020. 
-Level "e", less than high-school, has dropped from around
18dph in 1973 to around 16dph in 2022.

Between education levels: we observe large dispersion on pay values,
around 38dph wages difference between levels "e" and "a"(16-54) in 2022 
(wages "a" being 2,3 times that of wages "e"). 
In 1973 dispersion was at 19dph (18-37) (wages "a" being 2 times that of 
wages "e"). 
An interesting finding is, wages for education levels (a,b) have grown through 
time, while wages in the c-d categories have stagnated (which means,
purchasing power should be much lower in 2022 with that level of wages versus 
the one enjoyed in 1973 with the same wages). Category "e" has decreased.

We'll now use a "facet wrap" plot to compare evolution of wages through
time (for each of the 5 education levels), and for the 6 race-gender
combinations: Black-Women, Black-Men; Hispanic-Women, Hispanic-Men;
White-Women, White-Men: This might help us identify any significant
differences among graphics:


```{r}
    df12_t %>%
      filter(race %in% c("Black", "White", "Hispanic") & gender %in% c("Women","Men")) %>%
      ggplot(aes(year, pay, color = edu_5)) +
      geom_line() +
      facet_wrap(~race ~gender)+
      xlab("YEAR [1973-2022]") +
      ylab("WAGES [$/h]") +
      ggtitle("Wages by education - Race-Gender MATRIX")
```


Observations:

1.  On RACE and GENDER.

1.1.RACE-GENDER gap: 

-White_Men are the best paid at equal level of education, for all 5 education 
levels; the best paid of any race-gender combination. Specially for higher 
education levels. 
-Hispanic_Women are the worst paid group at the highest education level. 
We can print a few values confirming these observations from the plot:


```{r}
    which.max(df12_t$pay)
    df12_t$pay[452]
    df12_t$race[452]
    df12_t$gender[452]
    #[1] 64.04 [1] "White" [1] "Men"
    which.min(df12_t$pay)
    df12_t$pay[1278]
    df12_t$race[1278] 
    df12_t$gender[1278]
    #[1] 11.35 [1]"Hispanic" [1] "Women"
```


These are coherent with our perception:
Best (pay) wages value of all across our data belongs to the White_Men group;
Worst (pay) wages value of all across our data, belongs to the Hispanic_Women 
group.

1.2. GENDER gap: 

-The lowest gender gap within a race seems to be within the Black group. 
Both gender distributions through time are similar, at similar values. 
-The White and Hispanic groups showing a larger gap between gender.
-White group, gap between Women and Mean is around a 40% plus pay for Men, 
for all education levels. In absolute values,the more education level, the 
larger the absolute value differential. 
-Hispanic group: Men receive between 30 to 40% more pay than Women, for the 
same education level.

We can produce a plot considering only GENDER (race within), for a more generic view of
the effect of gender on pay:
Overview of pay evolution through time for the two considered genders(plus All):


```{r}
    df12_t %>%
      filter(race =="All" & edu_5 %in% c("a","b","c","d","e")) %>%
      ggplot(aes(year, pay, color = edu_5)) +
      geom_line() +
      facet_wrap(~gender)+
      xlab("YEAR [1973-2022]") +
      ylab("WAGES [$/h]") +
      ggtitle("Wages by gender - for all education levels")
```


Overall (not splitting gender by race), Men wages are well above those of Women. 
All the way from 1973 until 2022. Furthermore, the gap (i.e."a" level, 
1973: 33-40 to 2022: 44-63) seems to have increased (in absolute values) 
through time.

1.3. RACE gap: 

-White_Men are the best paid group, while White_Women receive a worse wages than 
Hispanic_Men and Black_Men and Women, at high education levels. 
-Hispanic Men are better paid than Black Men and Women, however Hispanic 
Women receive lower wages than Black Mean and Women.

It appears that race and gender are key-factors, which combined result in the 
observed effects. 
In order to view a more generic picture of the race gap, we could represent a 
Race based plot, which combines genders within each race group:


```{r}
    df12_t %>% filter(race %in% c("Black", "White", "Hispanic") & gender == "All") %>%
      ggplot(aes(year, pay, color = edu_5)) +
      geom_line() +
      facet_wrap(~race)+
      xlab("YEAR [1973-2022]") +
      ylab("WAGES [$/h]") +
      ggtitle("Wages by race - for all education levels")
```


This "Wages by race - for all education levels" helps compare wages among races.
When not considering gender(race values combining here both genders) separately,
then we can see that:
-The best wages for education levels a,b,c,d have been through time for the 
White group.
-Hispanic where paid less than Black and White in 1973, however Hispanic are 
paid more than Black for the top education levels a,b in 2022, however still 
worse than the White group.
-The White group at the lowest education level "e", where paid more than 
Hispanic, and Hispanic in turn more than Black group members, in 1973. However 
in 2022 the White group is the second best paid at edu_5 level "e", behind 
Hispanic, remaining the Black group as the worst paid at level "e".

Similar to the  former representations, but with focus on each EDUCATION level 
across RACE, following is a plot "Wages by race - for all edu_5":


```{r}
    df12_t %>% filter(edu_5 %in% c("a","b","c","d","e") & gender=="All") %>%
      ggplot(aes(year, pay, color=race)) +
      geom_line()+
      facet_grid(~ edu_5)+
      xlab("YEAR [1973-2022]") +
      ylab("WAGES [$/h]")+
      ggtitle("Wages by race - for all edu_5")
```


This approach reveals that, after the mid 80s:

-The White-group (genders mixed) perceive the highest wages for all education 
levels b,c,d through time.For level "a" the same it true after the mid 80s;
for level "e", the White-Group (genders mixed) is in 2nd place,being the best 
paid the Hispanic-group, the worst the Back-group.
-The Hispanic-group perceive the second highest wages (except a short periods 
i.e. in the early 2000s);
-The Black-group perceive the lowest wages.


2.  On TIME(year) and EDUCATION(edu_5).

From the plots we've viewed so far, 

2.1. Time effect: consistently,
-(a,b) GROWING wages: for "a" and "b" education levels, although oscillations 
(positive, negative slopes) are observed, a general positive trend is observed 
through time on wages. 
-(c,d) STAGNANT wages: For levels "c" and "d", wages are overall stagnant
through time;
-(e) DECREASING wages: For level "e", wages have decreased over time.

2.2. Education level effect: we've covered this variable before. As a generic 
consistent finding, for all other variable effect combinations, education 
remains a key variable, its effect on wages coherent across all visual 
representations of data. 
Conclusion: across time, the higher the education level, the higher the wages.

Finally, we can display the starting (year 1973) and end (year 2022) points of 
the time scale being considered, observe how pay-race fare (comparison between 
starting and end points):

Faceting:


```{r}
    filter(df12_t, year%in%c(1973, 2022) & gender=="All") %>%
      ggplot(aes(race, pay, col = edu_5)) +
      geom_point() +
      facet_grid(. ~ year)+
      xlab("YEAR [1973 and 2022]") +
      ylab("WAGES [$/h]")+
      ggtitle("Wages by race and education")
```


Overview of starting and ending points, for each education level for each race.
We can appreciate coherence with former representations. It stands out that for 
level "e" the White-group comes in seond place, consistent with former findings.

Further visualization of the education level effects. We can add a boxplot
for a visual representation of wages versus education, where time, race, gender 
explain the position of the box-plot defining values (mean, quartiles, range, 
plus outliers).


```{r}
      b_p <- df12_t %>%
      filter(year == 2022 & !is.na(pay)) %>%
      ggplot(aes(edu_5, pay)) +
      geom_boxplot() +
      theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1))+
      geom_point(alpha = 0.5)+
      xlab("EDUCATION LEVEL") +
      ylab("WAGES [$/h]")+
      ggtitle("Wages by education level")
      b_p
```


In addition to that, we can represent the generic effect of time on wages.
Facet_grid density plots can help us with visualizing trends. We'll select four 
points in time (years 1983,1993,2003,2013) quite evenly distributed between the 
starting point in our time scale (1973) and the ending point (2022):


```{r}
   filter(df12_t, year %in% c(1973,1983, 1993,2003,2013, 2022) & gender=="All") %>%
      ggplot(aes(pay)) +
      geom_density(fill="blue")+
      facet_grid(. ~ year)+
      xlab("WAGES") +
      ylab("DENSITY")+
      ggtitle("Evolution of wages")
```


This graphic shows a growth of wages density towards higher ones through time, 
consistent with an increasing gap between education wages levels, growth of 
wages for "a" and "b" education levels through time, and stagnation for "c" 
and "d", along together with a wage decrease for the "e" level of education.

We can summarize our findings after data visualization work. 
GENERAL CONCLUSIONS after data wrangling and visualization: 

1.level of education has the highest effect on pay; 

2.time has an effect on pay, which varies according to edu_5: 
-2.1."a","b" levels growing; 
-2.2."c","d" stagnating; 
-2.3."e" levels decreasing. 

2.Race consistently (through time) affects the level of pay for the same 
education level,being -in general- White the highest paid, Hispanic following, 
and Black last;

3.Gender has been and continues to be a factor affecting pay level. Men are 
paid more than Women across education level and race; 4.Through time wages are 
increasing for higher levels of education (a, b), and showing stagnation for 
the lower levels of education (c,d),and decreasing for the lowest (e), across 
races and genders.





## Part 4. Initial solution.


Our working hypothesis will be based on the work we've done so far with
Data Visualization.

We'll fit models which consider education, gender and race effects, separately, 
then a global model which considers effects from education, gender and race. 
We'll start considering race, gender, the race+gender, then a stronger variable, 
edu_5, and finally all of them combined, including year too, as following: 

fit1 [pay \~ race] 
fit2 [pay \~ gender] 
fit3 [pay \~ gender + race] 
fit4 [pay \~ edu_5 ] 
fit5 [pay \~ edu_5 + gender + race] 
fit6 [pay \~ edu_5 + year + gender + race]

Least squares:

We will try first the race effect on wages (pay ~ race). 
Race effect _ pay - fitting a linear model:


```{r}
    fit1 <- lm(pay ~ as.factor(race), data = df12_t)
    fit1
    summary(fit1)
```


Fitting a linear model with pay as dependent and race as independent variables, 
data from df12_t:
-we obtain an intercept of 27.4589 and slopes for Black (-1.8798), 
Hispanic(-2.4815) and White (0.6016).
-According to this, we observe a positive effect on pay for the White group, and 
negative effects for then Black and Hispanic groups. 
-p-values are very low for Black and Hispanic (good predictors), but over 0.05 
for White. 
-Residuals are large. 
-Multiple R squared is far from 1, the model can explain some 1,4% of the 
variability.


Then we'll study the gender effect on pay (gender ~ race):


```{r}
    fit2 <- lm(pay ~ as.factor(gender), data=df12_t)
    summary(fit2)
```


Fitting a linear model with pay as dependent, gender as independent variables, 
data from df12_t:
-we obtain an intercept of 26.365 and slopes for Men (3.104) and Women (-2.641).
-gender=Men adds to the pay value while gender=Women reduces pay.
-p-values are very low for gender, both for Men and Women, thus the predictors 
are good. 
-However residuals are very high. 
-Multiple R squared is far from 1, the model can explain some 5% of the 
variability.


Now we'll combine gender and race, see how its combined effects improve the 
model:


```{r}
    fit3 <- lm(pay ~ as.factor(gender) + as.factor(race), data=df12_t)
    summary(fit3)
    plot(fit3$residuals, pch = 16, col = "red")
```


Fitting a linear model with pay as dependent and gender and race as independent 
variables, data from df12_t:
-we obtain an intercept of 26.365 and slopes for Men (3.104) and Women (-2.641);
-slopes for Black (-1.8798), Hispanic (-2.4815), and White (0.6016);
-gender=Men and race=White adds to the pay (wages) while gender=Women and 
race=Hispanic or Black reduces pay;
-p-values are very low for Men, Women, Black, Hispanic, making these good 
predictors, however White shows a 0.252 value (>0.05).
-Residuals remain large.
-Multiple R squared is still far from 1. The model can explain some 6,3% of the 
variability.


Following we study the effect of edu_5 on pay. Considering education level seems 
to be have the strongest effects on pay (hypothesis after perception from data 
visualization):


```{r}
    fit4 <- lm(pay ~ edu_5, data=df12_t)
    summary(fit4)
    plot(fit4$residuals, pch = 16, col = "red")
```


Fitting a linear model with pay as dependent and edu_5 as independent variables, 
data from df12_t:
-we obtain an intercept of 41.7710 and negative slopes for edu levels b,c,d 
and e.
-p-values are low across the education levels, thus the predictor(s) are good.
-However residuals keep being large. 
-Multiple R squared is now close to 1, the model can explain some 82% of the 
variability.
-This is a KEY FINDING, this confirms the perception that EDUCATION LEVEL has 
the MOST EFFECT on PAY(wages).


We'll now fit a model with "edu_5", "gender", and "race" as independent 
variables (pay ~ edu_5 + gender + race):


```{r}
    fit5 <- lm(pay ~ as.factor(edu_5) + as.factor(gender) + as.factor(race), data=df12_t)
    summary(fit5)
    plot(fit5$residuals, pch = 16, col = "red")
```


Fitting a linear model with pay as dependent and edu_5, gender, race as 
independent variables, data from df12_t: 
-we obtain an intercept of 42.5568 and positive slopes for Men and White, and 
negative slopes for edu levels b,c,d and e, Women, Black, and Hispanic.
-p-values are low across the education levels, thus the predictor(s) are good.
-Residuals have decreased (-17 to +18).
-Multiple R squared is now close to 1, the model can explain some 88.5% of the 
variability.

This is the best model version yet.

As a last potential improvement, let's add to it YEAR as independent variable:


Finally, we'll fit a model with "edu_5", "year", "gender", and "race" as independent 
variables (pay ~ edu_5 + year + gender + race):


```{r}
    fit6 <- lm(pay ~ as.factor(edu_5) + as.factor(year)+ as.factor(gender) + as.factor(race), data=df12_t)
    summary(fit6)
    plot(fit6$residuals, pch = 16, col = "red")
```


Fitting a linear model with pay as dependent and edu_5, year, gender, race as 
independent variables, data from df12_t: 
-we obtain an intercept of 41.79359 and positive slopes for Men and White,
and years from 1998 to 2022; 
-and negative slopes for edu levels b,c,d and e, Women, Black, and Hispanic, 
and years 1973-1997;
-p-values are low across all variables-values, expect for years 1973-1997.
-Residuals have decreased (-15 to +14).
-Multiple R squared is now close to 1, the model can explain some 91.1% of the 
variability.





## Part 5. Solution.


Building a "Recommendation System" tool - Machine Learning Model -. 
Now we'll be interested on projecting expected wages (pay) through the
period, 1973-2022. We can start with defining the overall pay average,
through time, and across all relevant variables, education level, race,
and gender.

We'll work with a "recommendation system" tool. We will create a simple 
model -algorithm- which we will improve through a sequence of steps 
(successive models). Using a training set (train_set) and a test set 
(test_set) to assess the accuracy of the models. The RMSE function (residual 
mean square error) will help us evaluate model accuracy. By calculating 
the error made between prediction of wages, and true wages.


Creating train and test sets:


```{r}
    library(caret)
    set.seed(755)
    test_index <- createDataPartition(y = df12_t$pay, times = 1, p = 0.2,
                                      list = FALSE)
    #test_index
    train_set <- df12_t[-test_index,]
    test_set <- df12_t[test_index,]
    head(train_set)
    head(test_set)
    
    #To make sure we donât include RACE and GENDER in the test set that do not appear in the
    #training set, we remove these entries using the semi_join function:
    test_set <- test_set %>%
      semi_join(train_set, by = "race") %>%
      semi_join(train_set, by = "gender")
    head(test_set)
    
    #The RMSE function
    RMSE <- function(true_pay, predicted_pay){
      sqrt(mean((true_pay - predicted_pay)^2))
    }
    #A FIRST MODEL:
    mu_hat <- mean(df12_t$pay)
    mu_hat
    #> #[1]  26.51901
  
    naive_rmse <- RMSE(test_set$pay, mu_hat)
    naive_rmse
    #> #[1] 10.70215
```


NOTE - CLAUSE:
Regarding significance of the obtained values, considering the nature of our 
data:
-The obtained mu_hat is the average wages(pay), through the considered period, 
and all variables.
-We've got sets of data referring to ALL genders and ALL races. 
-and also sets of data, specific for a matrix of gender-race values.
        
Let's see if these two (generic-ALL ; matrix) types of data, are to be 
considered in this study, or a filter is to be applied.
And study if values for ALL genders-ALL races, are somehow equivalent to the 
combination of the 3 races and 2 genders being considered:
 
        #df12_t.All <- df12_t%>% filter( race=="All" & gender=="All")
        #str(df12_t.All)
        #mu_hat.All <- mean(df12_t.All$pay)
        #mu_hat.All
        #[1] 27.6932
        
        #we've got 6 groups of 250 observations, each based on generic 
        #information (including more than variable variation within, for example 
        #all White observations, which include both genders within)
        #These are "All"; "All MEN"; "All WOMEN";"All White"; "All Black"; 
        #"All Hispanic".
        
        #if we only include observations with independent variables defining 
        #the observation value (matrix of genders x races), we might get more 
        #accurate variable -effectapproximations. 
        
        #df12_t.matrix <- df12_t%>% filter( race %in% 
              #c("Black","White","Hispanic") & gender %in% c("Women","Men"))
        #str(df12_t.matrix)
        #mu_hat.matrix <- mean(df12_t.matrix$pay)
        #mu_hat.matrix
        #[1] 26.34754
        
        #naive_rmse
        #[1] 10.34644 for df12_t.matrix, a little lower than the former 
        #10.706  (for df12_t)
        
        #We might want to select df12_t.matrix from here. However the observed 
        #difference between using one (all data) 
        #or the other ("matrix" data only) approach is small (delta-mu = 0.17; 
        #delta-rmse= 0.35 )
        
Conclusion on note: We will consider all available data for our study.

## MODEL 6.
REGULARIZATION

-By considering the education, race, gender and year effect in our
model, we have improved model accuracy, now well below the initial 10,7
value. -We could further improve model accuracy, by using
regularization, removing effects of noisy estimates (penalizing large
estimates coming from small sample sizes).Anomalies in pay curves
through time.

Regularization is not doing much here, we could conclude there isn't
much "noise" to be neutralized. Our model including "year" produces the
best RMSE.
MODEL 5, considering edu_5, year, race, and gender variables, provides the 
lowest RMSE (3,2623). This is the best result - recommendation model- we've
developed in this study.





## Part 6 - CONCLUSIONS.

     
GENERAL CONCLUSIONS after data wrangling and visualization, and modeling:

     
1.All variables (4 independent), education level (edu_5), time (year), 
gender (gender), race (race) have effects on wages (pay).

2.Level of EDUCATION has the highest effect on pay. The higher the education 
level, the higher wages,through time and for any race and gender;

3.TIME has an effect on pay:
-3.1."a" (advanced_degree) and "b" (bachelors_degree) levels growing through 
 time;
-3.2."c" (some_college) and "d" (high_school) stagnating;
-3.3."e" (lower_than_high-school)level decreasing through time.
Through time pay rates are increasing for higher levels of education (a, b), 
and showing stagnation for the lower levels of education (c,d),and decreasing 
for the lowest (e), across races and genders.

4.RACE consistently (through time) affects the level of pay for the same 
education level,being through time (in general, except a few anomalies) White 
the highest paid, Hispanic following, and Black last;

5.GENDER has been and continues to be a factor affecting pay level. Men are 
better paid than Women across education level and race;

6.Regarding combinations of RACE-GENDER: 
-White_Men are the best paid at equal level of education, for all 5 education 
levels; the best paid of any race-gender combination. 
Specially for higher education levels.
-Hispanic_Women are the worst paid group at the highest education level.

Effects of the 4 independent variables are shown on the various modeling 
approaches we've utilized in this study, coherent with these observations.
     
Note this study is based on the available data (selected data frame), and is 
therefore limited by the extension and depth of the data. As an example ,three 
races are considered only, while population in the USA includes a larger 
number of ethnicity. 

Nevertheless, this the study illustrates, within its limitations, the impact- 
effect, of the various considered demographics variables.The study could be 
further enriched by adding additional relevant complementary data to it.
