#Introduction:
#1. The subject of study.
#In this project weÂ´ll study evolution of salaries in the USA through the last 
#40 years.
#In particular we'll be interested in analyzing and describing relationships 
#between education and demographic variables and hourly pay rates.

#2. Measuring effects. How do these variables impact pay rates, how do the 
#potential effects of these variables
#evolve through time? Are there significant differences based on such variables?

#3. DATA. We'll use the data.set  "wages-by-education-in-the-usa-1973-2022" 
#from Kaggle. Using Data Wrangling and visualization, we will explore the data
#assess our first perceptions and define our working hypothesis. 

#4. In order to understand the test our working hypothesis, we'll utilize 
#least square estimates/linear regression techniques. 

#5. Further to this, we'll implement a model which will take into account the
#accumulative effects of variables on outcomes, 


#6. Finally we'll draw some conclusions, impact of the findings (effect of 
#variables) on the subject of study (pay- outcome).

    #[1] 'data.frame':	50 obs. of  61 variables
    #We'd like to have a more manageable data frame.We want to transform it 
    #to Tidy Data. 
    #Tidy format in which each row represents one observation and columns 
    #represent (combinations of) the different variables available for each of 
    #these observations. 
    #We could consolidate the information reshaping the data: we could organize 
    #data in 5 columns, 4 selection variables, Education level, Race, Gender, 
    #Year, and the result of the observation 
    #or fifth variable Pay (value USD per h). 
#We will iniciate the process of DATA WRANGLING, converting the data set to 
#tidy form. 
#We can observe that data can be organized in 12 groups: 
#-All, All-Men, All-Women, All-Black,All-White,All-Hispanic;
#-Men-Black, Women-Black, Men-White, Women-White, Men-Hispanic, Women-Hispanic.
#All of these groups have 5 possible values for the education level. 
#We'll generate following these 12 groups as data.frames from "wages_edu", all 
#with a Tidy format:  
    
#6B.1_wages_edu_all => year=all ; gen=all ; race=all ; level_edu=all five ; 
#pay=values

    #of education being considered. "edu_level" includes gender and race variables within in the original data frame structure.

    #This plot provides already a visual overview of the evolution of salary levels, 
    #based on the 5 different education levels considered, through time. 
    #By education level, through time, we observe:
    #Level "a", advanced degree, has evolved from around 37$/hour in 1973 to around 54$/h in 2022.
    #Level "b", bachelor degree, has evolved from around 33$/hour in 1973 to around 42$/h in 2022.
    #Level "c", some college, advanced degree, has changed little, from around 24$/hour in 1973 to around 25$/h in 2022.
    #Level "d", high-school, has stagnated around 22$/hour, from 1973 until 2022.Dropping 2-3$/h through the mid 90s, 
    #recovering in the mid 2000s,just to drop adn recover again around 2020.
    #Level "e", less than high-school, has dropped from around 18$/hour in 1973 to around 16$/h in 2022.
    #Between education levels: we observe large dispersion on pay values, around 38$/h pay difference 
    #between levels "e" and "a"(16-54) in 2022 (salary "a" being 2,3 times that of salary "e"). 
    #In 1973 dispersion was at 19$/h (18-37) (salary "a" being 2 times that of salary "e").
    #An interesting finding is, salaries for education levels (a,b) have grown through time, while salaries
    #in the c-d categories have stagnated (which means, purchasing power should be much lower in 2022
    #with that level of salary versus the one enjoyed in 1973 with the same pay). Category "e" has decreased.

    
#We'll now use a "facet wrap" plot to compare the pay evolution through time 
#(for each of the 5 education levels), and for the 6 race-gender combinations:
#Black-Women, Black-Men; Hispanic-Women, Hispanic-Men; White-Women, White-Men: 
#this might help us visualize significant differences among graphics:

#Observations:
#A. On race and gender,
#A.1.Race-Gender gap: 
    #-White_Men are the best paid at equal level of education, for all 5 education levels;
    #the best paid of any race-gender combination. Specially for higher education levels.
    #-Hispanic_Women are the worst paid group at the highest education level.
    #We can print a few values confirming these observations from the plot:

    #These are coherent with our perception:
    #Best (pay) value of all across our data belongs to the White_Men group;
    #Worst (pay) value of all across our data, belongs to the Hispanic_Women group.
    
#A.2. Gender gap: 
    #-The lowest gender gap within a race seems to be within the Black group. 
    #Both gender distributions through time are similar, at similar values.
    #-The White and Hispanic groups showing a larger gap between
    #gender, 
    #-White group, gap between Women and Mean is around a 40% plus pay for Men, for all education levels.
    #In absolute values,the more education level, the larger the absolute value differential. 
    #-Hispanic group: Men receive between 30 to 40% more pay than Women, for the same education level.
    
    #we can produce a plot considering only GENDER (race within), for a more generic view of

    #Overall (not splitting gender by race), Men pay rates are well above those of Women's. 
    #all the way from 1973 until 2022. Furthermore, the gap (1973: 32-40 to 2022: 44-63) seems
    #to have grown.
    
#A.3. Race gap: 
    #-White_Men are the best payed group, while White_Women receive a worse pay then Hispanic_Men and Black_Men and 
    #Women, at high education levels.
    #-Hispanic Men are better payed than Black Men and Women, however Hispanic Women are worse payed 
    #than Black Mean and Women.
    
    #it seems that race and gender are key-factors which combined result in the observed effects.

    #this "Salary by education and race" helps compare salaries among races.
    #when not considering gender (race values combining here both genders) separately,
    #then we can see that:
    #-The best pay for education levels a,b,c,d has been through time for the White group.
    #-Hispanic where paid less than Black and White in 1973, however Hispanic are
    #paid more than Black for the top education levels a,b, still worse than the White group.
    #-The White group at the lowest education level, where paid more than Hispanic, these more
    #than Black group members, in 1973. However in 2022 the White group is the second best paid
    #at edu_5 level "e", behind Hispanic, remaining the Black group as the worst paid one

    #-White perceive the highest salaries;

    #-Black perceive the lowest salaries.
    
#B. on time and education: 
#B.1. Time effect: consistently, 
    #-for "a" and "b" education levels, although oscillations (positive, negative slopes) 
    #are observed, a positive trend is observed through time. 
    #-For levels "c" and "d", salaries are overall stagnant, through time;
    #-For level "e", pay level has decreased over time.
    
#B.2. Education level effect: we've covered this variable before, nevertheless, as a generic consistent
    #finding, for all other variable effect combinations, education remains a key variable, its effect  
    #coherent across all visual representations of data:

    #growth of "a"-"b" education levels through time, and stagnation (with even decrese in level of pay,
    #in some decades) for "e"-"d".. levels of education.
    
#We can summarize our findings after data visualization work.
#GENERAL CONCLUSIONS after data wranging and visualization:
    #1.level of education has the highest effect on pay;
    #2.time has an effect on pay:
      #-2.1."a","b" levels growing;
      #-2.2."c","d" stagnating;
      #-2.3."e" levels decreasing.
    #2.race consistently (through time) affects the level of pay for the same education level,
    #being White the highest paid, hispanic following, and black last;
    #3. gender has been and continues to be a factor affecting pay level. Men are paid more than Women 
    #across education level and race;
    #4.through time pay rates are increasing for higher levels of education (a, b), and showing 
    #stagnation for the lower levels of education (c,d),and decreasing for the lowest (e), across races and genders. 
    

#Part 4. Initial solution.   
    #Our working hypothesis will be based on the work we've done so far with Data Visualization.
    #we'll fit a model which considers education, gender and race effects, separately, then a
    #global model which considers effects from education, gender and also race.
    #we'll start considering race, gender, the race+gender, then a stronger variable edu_5, and 
    #finally all of them combined, as following:
    #fit1 [pay ~ race]
    #fit2 [pay ~ gender]
    #fit3 [pay ~ gender + race]

##Part 6 - CONCLUSIONS.
     
     #GENERAL CONCLUSIONS after data wranging and visualization, and modeling:
     
     #1.All variables (4 independent), education level (edu_5), time (year), gender (gender), race (race) have effects on 
     #wages (pay).
     #2.Level of EDUCATION has the highest effect on pay. The higher the education level, the higher wages,
     #through time and for any race and gender;
     #3.TIME has an effect on pay:
     #-3.1."a" (advanced_degree) and "b" (bachelors_degree) levels growing through time;
     #-3.2."c" (some_college) and "d" (high_school) stagnating;
     #-3.3."e" (lower_than_high-school)level decreasing thorugh time.
     #Through time pay rates are increasing for higher levels of education (a, b), and showing 
     #stagnation for the lower levels of education (c,d),and decreasing for the lowest (e), across 
     #races and genders.
     #2.RACE consistently (through time) affects the level of pay for the same education level,
     #being through time (in general, except a few anomalies) White the highest paid, Hispanic following, 
     #and Black last;
     #4.GENDER has been and continues to be a factor affecting pay level. Men are paid more than Women 
     #across education level and race;
     #5.Regarding combinations of RACE-GENDER: 
     #-White_Men are the best paid at equal level of education, for all 5 education levels;
     #the best paid of any race-gender combination. Specially for higher education levels.
     #-Hispanic_Women are the worst paid group at the highest education level.
     # Effects of the 4 independent variables are shown on the various modeling approaches we've 
     # utilized in this study, coherent with these observations.
     
     #Note this study is based on the available data (selected data frame), and is therefore limited by
     #the extension and depth of the data. As an example ,three races are considered only, while population 
     #in the USA includes a quite larger number of ethnicities. 
     #Nevertheless, this the study illustrates, within its limitations, the impact- effect, of the various 
     #considered sociodemographic variables.The study could be further enriched by adding additional relevant complementary data to it.
